Deep Learning Machine Learning modelling Repo:  

This repository provides a guide for deep learning modelling of different datasets using python.  

**Overview of deep learning modelling for Mnist digits classification project**    
-- 70000 digit images from Mnist dataset have been used for multi class classifications  
-- Dense neural network has been tested for image classification     
-- Convolutional neural network (CNN) used for modeling      

**Overview of Transfer learning for flower image classification project**    
-- 3500 flower photos have been used for multi class classification of flowers between 5 groups:  
 ("roses", "daisy", "dandelion", "sunflowers", "tulips") each containes about 700 images  
-- convolutional neural network (CNN) and data agumentaion has been tasted for classification of flowers  
-- Transfer Learning with pre-trained model of fishes download from tensorflow.hub used for flower image classification  
-- Transfer learning with Inception model used for flower image classification  


**Overview of Transfer learning for image classification project**    
-- The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class has been used for image classification project  
-- Convolutional neural network (CNN) and data agumentaion has been tested for image classification
